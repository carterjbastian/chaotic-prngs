Software for Math53 Final Project, 15F

Code Organization:
All source code for the actual CPRNGs is in the src/ directory.
The maps are implemented with maps.c and maps.h
The generators themselves are implemented, created, and designed with 
generators.c and generators.h
The utils.c and utils.h files have basic utility functions that are necessary
for IO and working with data types.
The functionality and actual sample usage of CPRNGs is in the file run_prng.c
RunTests.sh is a bash script for automatically building the CPRNGs and running 
the dieharder tests (as well as placing results in the correct places).

Dependencies:
dieharder Test Suite.

To build the software and run the tests, navigate to the source directory
and type the following into your command line:
./RunTests.sh


Beware that the testing suite takes a long time to complete.
